# simple-SD-trainer
As a AIGC rookie, I want to go ahead and try to reproduce some of the basic abilities of the text-to-image model, including Lora, ControlNet, IP-adapter, where you can use these features to realize a range of interesting AIGC plays.

To this end, We will keep a complete record of how these abilities are trained, and our future plans can be broadly categorized into:

- [SDXL]
  - [Lora]
  - [ControlNet]
  - [IP-adapter]
- [DiT]
  - [PixArt]
  - [Stable Diffusion 3]
- [Application]
  - [Personalized avatar]
  - [Style Transformation]
  - [Virtual tryon]
